<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I planned to have some shell scripts in the end but only to see that it works 
</I>&gt;<i> and to make some power users happy :-)
</I>&gt;<i> It is true that each implementation expects an own installation location. Even 
</I>&gt;<i> in some cases where it is stupid, e.g. the wallpaper, such an intrinsic piece 
</I>&gt;<i> of data, and yet so difficult to manage.
</I>&gt;<i> So the above is not high priority I'd say.
</I>
Sometimes it is not only done by copying the data to the target
location. For example the GNOME wallpapers has to be added in a xml
file. The scripts should also be able to do this.

&gt;<i> I also think that with SOAP it's possible to reduce traffic by only getting 
</I>&gt;<i> the data one really needs. The art.gnome.org XML file is &gt; 6000 lines long.
</I>
Yeah right. This is also an important fact. 

&gt;<i> So there would be a start for WSDL messages already:
</I>&gt;<i> * AuthenticationRequest
</I>&gt;<i> * ListRequest
</I>&gt;<i> * DownloadRequest
</I>&gt;<i> * Comment or RateRequest
</I>&gt;<i> ... and the answers to all of these.
</I>
Right. It is also possible to use the HTTP Authentication I heard. But I
am not sure, if this is the right way for authentication.

&gt;<i> I also had a few ideas. One is that I read about volatile.debian.net and how 
</I>&gt;<i> they keep e.g. spamassassin signatures up to date. This is not exactly a 
</I>&gt;<i> desktop topic but who knows what kind of data might be next.
</I>
Maybe we need signatures for our desktop data too. E.g. some data (gtk
theme engines) need to be compiled. Eventually we also have other kind
of data that could need a signature to be sure, that the data is checked
and secure. 

&gt;<i> The second is just a small improvement over what is currently used:
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to the &quot;category&quot; entry (or &quot;type&quot; in our case), a i18n'd human 
</I>&gt;<i> readable string should be introduced. For instance, where it now reads 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;freeciv/level&quot;, it would then say &quot;Freeciv levels&quot;. The 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;kdeedu/vocabularies&quot; category would be &quot;Vocabulary files&quot;. And so on.
</I>
yeah this is nice. But why in addition to the category? Do we need both?
The type freeciv/level etc. should be enough to describe the category.

Greetings

Mike
