&gt;<i> Well, the first thing we need is a list of the different stuff and a

</I>&gt;<i> can take a look on it and see, what kind of stuff can be downloaded and
</I>&gt;<i> write its own installation procedure. Or did you plan to write some
</I>&gt;<i> basic console scripts to install stuff and that the clients only use
</I>&gt;<i> these scripts?
</I>
I planned to have some shell scripts in the end but only to see that it works 
and to make some power users happy :-)
It is true that each implementation expects an own installation location. Even 
in some cases where it is stupid, e.g. the wallpaper, such an intrinsic piece 
of data, and yet so difficult to manage.
So the above is not high priority I'd say.

&gt;<i> - wallpaper-specific options (resolution) -&gt; generic options
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With DXS you simply can get a whole datastructure with a list of
</I>&gt;<i> wallpaper specific options.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> - maybe differential downloads or separate lists for most popular/most
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded/latest
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah. Especially with SOAP we can have functions like:
</I>&gt;<i> get_most_popular_theme(start, end) which returns the most popular
</I>&gt;<i> themes, beginning from start to end. Or similar to this:
</I>&gt;<i> get_most_downloaded_theme. Or we simply have functions like:
</I>&gt;<i> get_theme(start, end, sort). So the client has the possibilty to get all
</I>&gt;<i> the themes, it wants to display.
</I>
I also think that with SOAP it's possible to reduce traffic by only getting 
the data one really needs. The art.gnome.org XML file is &gt; 6000 lines long.

&gt;<i> - maybe a way to browse all creative works from an author
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yup. I also have some points:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - user registration (if allowed by the administrator)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The client should be able to register some new user accounts for writing
</I>&gt;<i> comments, or uploading stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - read/write comments
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A user should be able to read and write comments on the client side. A
</I>&gt;<i> registration should be required.
</I>
So there would be a start for WSDL messages already:
* AuthenticationRequest
* ListRequest
* DownloadRequest
* Comment or RateRequest
... and the answers to all of these.

I also had a few ideas. One is that I read about volatile.debian.net and how 
they keep e.g. spamassassin signatures up to date. This is not exactly a 
desktop topic but who knows what kind of data might be next.

The second is just a small improvement over what is currently used:
In addition to the &quot;category&quot; entry (or &quot;type&quot; in our case), a i18n'd human 
readable string should be introduced. For instance, where it now reads 
&quot;freeciv/level&quot;, it would then say &quot;Freeciv levels&quot;. The 
&quot;kdeedu/vocabularies&quot; category would be &quot;Vocabulary files&quot;. And so on.
