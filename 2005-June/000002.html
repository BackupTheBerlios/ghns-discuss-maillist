<PRE>Hi,

first thanks to josef for this mailinglist! Ok, let&#180;s go:

- the Desktop Exchange Service (DXS) would need a WSDL which specifies
which 
parameters it expects for uploads, downloads and other actions (voting
could 
be handled too by it couldn't it?)

The DXS should be a kind of interface between the client and the server.
With SOAP the client has the possibility to access all functions and
data of the providing webpage. 

So: The client can access specific themes, or simply can send requests
for votes, user registration, user queries and so on. With this
interface the client becomes a complete frontend for the whole webpage.
With the required authentication it should be also possible to send
votes, or write comments.


- common client-side actions, like post-installation scripts,
decompression, 
signature verification and &quot;fake installations&quot; (that is, if a distro
package 
is upgraded, the download dialog should be able to know if an item has
been 
installed already)

Well, the first thing we need is a list of the different stuff and a
description how it has to be installed. So every implementation of GHNS
can take a look on it and see, what kind of stuff can be downloaded and
write its own installation procedure. Or did you plan to write some
basic console scripts to install stuff and that the clients only use
these scripts?

And one point: GHNS isn&#180;t only for GNOME, or only for KDE. So: when
providing installation instructions, or writing an implementation for
more than one desktop environment, we should also provide installation
information for the different desktop environments: 
For example: Wallpapers on KDE are installed differently to GNOME or
XFCE wallpapers. We shouldn&#180;t forget about this.


- wallpaper-specific options (resolution) -&gt; generic options

With DXS you simply can get a whole datastructure with a list of
wallpaper specific options.

- maybe differential downloads or separate lists for most popular/most 
downloaded/latest

Yeah. Especially with SOAP we can have functions like:
get_most_popular_theme(start, end) which returns the most popular
themes, beginning from start to end. Or similar to this:
get_most_downloaded_theme. Or we simply have functions like:
get_theme(start, end, sort). So the client has the possibilty to get all
the themes, it wants to display.

- maybe a way to browse all creative works from an author

Yup. I also have some points:

- user registration (if allowed by the administrator)

The client should be able to register some new user accounts for writing
comments, or uploading stuff. 

- read/write comments

A user should be able to read and write comments on the client side. A
registration should be required.



Greetings

Mike
