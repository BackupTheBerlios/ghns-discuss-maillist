<PRE>L to the physical, from the superstitious to the true. &quot;Satisfied that
we had a mass of Lias clay before us, we set vigorously to work, in
order either to find additional characteristic fossils, or obtain data
on which to form a conjecture as to the history of this out-of-the-way
deposit; and our labor was not without its reward. We shall now present
a brief account of the specimens we picked up. Observing a number of
stones of different sizes, that had been thrown out, as they were
struck, by the workman's shovel, we immediately commenced, and, like an
inquisitor of old, knocked our victims on the head, that they might
reveal their secrets; or, like a Roman haruspex, examined their
interior,--not, however, to obtain a knowledge of the future, but only
to take a peep into the past. 1. Here, then, we take up, not a regular
Lias lime nodule, but what appears to have formed part of one; and the
first blow has laid open part of a whorl of an Ammonite, which, when
complete, must have measured three or four inches in diameter, and it is
perfectly assimilated to the calcareous matrix. 2. Here is a mass of
indurated clay; and a gentle blow has exposed part of two Ammonites,
smaller than the former, but their shells are white and powdery like
chalk. 3. Another fragment is laid open; and there, quite unmistakably,
lie the umbo and greater portion of the _Plagiostoma concentricum_. 4.
Another fragment of a granular gritty structure presents a considerable
portion of the interior of one of the shells of a Pecten, but whether
the attached fragment is part of one of its ears, or of the other valve
turned backward, is not so easily determined. 5. Here is a piece of
Belemnite in limeston
